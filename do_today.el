;; A Quick Guide to Org-Mode TODO's

;; https://youtu.be/-_e91NhFObU

;; [href=http://orgmode.org/](Org-mode) is one of the
;; crowning jewels of [href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/](EMacs).
;; It is, without doubt, the
;; reigning champion of
;; text-based organizational
;; systems - anything you want
;; to do with text you can do
;; with Org.

;; I've been using Org for a
;; while now and it has
;; constantly amazed me with
;; it's unfolding set of
;; features - Scheduling,
;; prioritizing, unlimited
;; hierarchies, archives,
;; capture inbox items, refile,
;; hyperlinks, tables, markup
;; formatting, exporting,
;; tags... the list looks
;; endless, the implementation
;; is smooth, rock-solid, and
;; phenomenally usable.

;; The fact that Org is not as
;; popularily used is sad. I
;; think there may be two
;; reasons:
;;     1. There are so many
;;     features there is no
;;     obvious place to start.
;;     2. It works best when
;;     you know how to use
;;     EMacs and ELisp.

;; So, in this quick post, I
;; will show you how to start
;; using Org and the basics of
;; using EMacs and ELisp to
;; have a really useful TODO
;; list to manage your day.

;; We will start from scratch,
;; quickly build a workable
;; todo planner system and then
;; I will show you how to
;; customize it by learning
;; some (e)Lisp.

;; Learning Lisp is also really
;; nice for programmers because
;; it is _*so very different*_
;; from our normal Java/C++
;; languages.  Being exposed to
;; different ideas can really
;; help us grow into better
;; (and more productive)
;; programmers.

;; Plus Lisp is _*FUN*_ and easy
;; to get started with. You'll
;; have a blast!

;; *_So let's dive in!_* 

;; First we make sure we've
;; got EMacs installed. It is
;; available for [href=https://emacsformacosx.com/](Mac), [href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html](Windows),
;; and [href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html](Linux). The latest EMacs
;; versions come with Org
;; pre-installed so we should
;; be good to go. (If not,
;; [href=http://orgmode.org/](installing org-mode) is
;; pretty easy).

;; Great. You should now have a
;; screen looking like this:

;;  emacs-startup.png

;; (Notice the tutorial link?
;; It's an excellent start to
;; the basics of using EMacs
;; which you should check out
;; after this post. For now, I
;; will show you what to do so
;; you don't need it).

;; Use:
;;
;;  Control-e:  End of line
;;  Control-a:  Start of line
;;
;;  Control-/:  Undo
;;  Control-G:  Get me out of here
;;              (when stuck)

;; Now you know enough to let
;; you get through this post.
;; After that do read the EMacs
;; tutorial.

;; Because EMacs is an _OOOOLD_
;; editor - it has some funny
;; naming conventions you
;; should know:

;;  emacs-naming.png

;; And we're ready to go!

;; The first principle of
;; productivity is:

;; *_A Blunt Pencil is worth
;; more than a Sharp Mind_*

;;  blunt-pencil.png

;; In other words - _*always use
;; a todo list!*_ To do this,
;; we will create a new Org
;; file and enter our todo
;; items. Start by clicking the
;; first icon on your EMacs
;; toolbar and provide the
;; filename "todo.org". The
;; extension ".org" will tell
;; EMacs that we want to treat
;; this file as an Org file.

;; Next we enter our TODO list.
;; Press Alt-Shift and hit the
;; ENTER key. Voila! A new TODO
;; item!

;;  first-todo.png

;; Add a few more TODO items to
;; practice.

;;  more-todos.gif

;; By now the Alt-Shift-ENTER
;; combo should be giving you an
;; idea of how EMacs works.
;; Almost all EMacs commands are
;; some combination of Control,
;; Alt, and Shift and written in
;; short form like this:
;;
;;  Control-x   :   C-x
;;  Alt-x       :   M-x (Alt = Meta)
;;  Shift-x     :   S-x


;; Now on any TODO line, try
;; <S-right> (Shift and right
;; arrow key). Neat huh? The
;; TODO marker will cycle
;; between:
;;     TODO --> DONE --> <none>

;;  cycle-status.gif

;; At first, these rather odd
;; commands will feel strange
;; but after a short time they
;; feel completely natural and
;; you'll be using them without
;; even thinking.

;; Now let's add some notes to
;; the TODO's. Go to the end of
;; any line (Control-E or C-e)
;; hit <enter> and then the
;; <tab> key. The <tab> key
;; will always bring you to the
;; right indentation level.

;;  todo-notes.png

;; We can also add lists:

;;  add-list.gif

;; <S-right> cycles between
;; different list types.

;;  cycle-lists.gif

;; We can add [href=http://orgmode.org/manual/Hyperlinks.html](hyperlinks),
;; [href=http://orgmode.org/manual/Images-and-tables.html](images), [href=http://orgmode.org/manual/Tables.html](tables), and
;; [href=http://orgmode.org/manual/Markup.html](formatting) to our notes.

;; We can also organize them
;; better. Use
;; M-S-<up,down,left,right> to
;; organize headings.

;;  reorg.gif

;; We can collapse and expand
;; these views at all levels to
;; get a overview and detail by
;; pressing the <tab> and
;; <s-tab> keys

;; As part of our TODO's it is
;; often helpful to list out a
;; checklist of items that need
;; to be completed to
;; accomplish our objective.
;; This is done by using a
;; simple list and adding the
;; `[ ]` text marker.

;;  checkboxes.png

;; These checkboxes can then by
;; toggled using C-c C-c

;;  cycle-checkboxes.gif

;; The last thing we will do is
;; to schedule tasks as that is
;; one really important way to
;; organize our tasks.
;; Scheduling is dead easy -
;;      C-c C-s

;;  schedule.gif

;; Org also comes with a number
;; of detailed reports (called
;; [href=http://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html](agenda views)) which you can use.
;; For now, though, let's build
;; our own report and learn some
;; ELisp on the way.

;; First let's figure out what
;; report we want. I'd like a
;; report of all the TODO's
;; due today (and any
;; associated checklists).
;; Also, when we hit ENTER on a
;; report line it should go back
;; to the original todo.

;; This is a simple but very
;; useful report. We can now
;; keep track of multiple
;; projects, keep things on
;; hold (by turning off the
;; TODO), and schedule things
;; to do in the future so they
;; don't show up now.

;;  todo-today-report.png

;; To create this report is
;; actually pretty easy. EMacs
;; is written entirely in a
;; dialect of [href=http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/introduction-why-lisp.html](LISP) called
;; [href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html](ELisp). All the editing,
;; display, window management,
;; and so on are done by
;; executing ELisp. Hence all
;; we have to do is write our
;; own ELisp functions and bind
;; them to some keys to extend
;; EMacs functionality to do
;; anything we want.

;; If you want to try things
;; out as you follow along,
;; open a new ELisp file
;; (end with extension .el) and
;; play around.

;; To understand LISP we ought
;; to start with the origins of
;; the name itself:

;;  LISP-List_Processing.png

;; We only need to understand
;; two things about LISP:
;;     1. Everything important
;;     is a list.
;;     2. Everything is
;;     evaluated.

;;  LISP-lists.png

;; Of course we understand what
;; it means to evaluate simple
;; things like strings and
;; numbers.
;; A number evaluates to
;; itself, strings evaluate to
;; themselves, and so do
;; characters etc:

;;  LISP-evals.png

;; A natural question we can ask
;; is:
;;
;;  How Are Lists Evaluated?
;;
;; The answer is simple:
;;
;; The first element is treated
;; as a function name and the
;; rest of the element are
;; parameters.
;;
;; For example:

;;  call-function.png

;; If any of the parameters are
;; themselves lists, the same
;; applies recursively:

;;  eval-params.png

;; So what happens if we want a
;; list of data such as:
;;     (1 2 3 4)
;; By our logic this will call
;; a function called `1` with
;; parameters `2`, `3`, and `4`
;; which is hardly what we
;; want.
;; What we need is a way to
;; mark expressions we do not
;; want evaluated and we do
;; this by quoting them:
;;     '(1 2 3 4)
;;     'x

;; Example:
;;  (1 2 3 4)   => Error! No function called `1`
;;  '(1 2 3 4)  => '(1 2 3 4)
;;  x           => value of x
;;  'x          => x

;; Now the ELisp for a
;; traditional "Hello World" is

;; (message "Hello World!")

;; Type this in and, just after
;; the ending brace type
;;     C-x C-e
;; which evaluates the
;; expression:

;;  hello-world.gif

;; We can also try

;; (insert "Hello World!")

;;  hello-world2.gif

;; Let's try to make his into a
;; function. The way to do this
;; is to create a list with the
;; first element `defun`
;; ("define function").

;; (defun hw()
;;     (insert "Hello World!"))

;; Now when you execute this
;; expression (C-x C-e) it will
;; simply define a function
;; called "hw". How do we
;; call this function?

;; One way is to create a list
;; with the first element as
;; this function and execute
;; that.

;; However, if we want to be
;; able to call our function
;; from anywhere we should mark
;; it as "interactive".
;;
;; (defun hw()
;;     (interactive)
;;     (insert "Hello World!"))
;;
;; Functions marked as
;; "interactive" can be called
;; by users directly by either
;; linking them to a keypress
;; (we will see this later) or
;; typing `M-x` (Alt-x) and the
;; function name.

;;  interactive-func.gif

;; So now that we know how to
;; create and invoke functions,
;; to create our report all we
;; have to do is create a
;; function that displays the
;; report and invoke it.

;; [=] What we want to do is
;; access the TODO report
;; anytime when we press a key
;; (say F5).
;;
;; [What you need to know]
;;  In EMacs every buffer has a
;;  mapping between a keypress
;;  and a lisp function to be
;;  called. Globally this is
;;  mantained in a variable
;;  called the `global-map`.
;;  A simple way to work with
;;  such "keymaps" is to use the
;;  following function:
(define-key global-map [f5] 'todays_todos)

;;  (This means that whenever the
;;  key F5 is pressed, call the
;;  function `todays_todos`.
;;  As described before, this
;;  function should be marked
;;  "interactive". This allows
;;  us to have many functions
;;  and only make a few
;;  available - something like
;;  an interface to our
;;  functionality).
;;
;;  Let's take a look at how to
;;  write that function next.

;; [=] Show the report
;; [+] Get all the todo's
;; and show them
;; [s] If no todos found or the
;; current buffer is not an
;; org-mode buffer, inform the
;; user.
;;
;; [What you need to know]
;;
;;  * An "if" works as follows:
;;      (if condition
;;          (do when true)
;;       (do when false))
;;
;;  * A "let" defines variables:
;;      (let ((var1 value1)
;;            (var2 value2))
;;          (some-func var1)
;;          (var2 is a function)
;;          (another-func var1 var2)
;;          ...) ;; "let" ends
;;      ;; so var1,var2 no longer available
;;
;; You may find it a little hard
;; to read the following
;; function at first but if you
;; just follow it closely it
;; will become really simple.
;; Trust me (or ping me if you
;; really need help!)
;;
(defun todays_todos()
  (interactive)
  (if (equal major-mode 'org-mode)
      (let ((todos (get_todays_todos)))
        (if todos
            (show_todays_todos todos)
          (user-error "No todo's in current file or org-agenda-files")))
    (user-error "File is not an ORG-MODE file")))

;; [!] Get today's todo's
;; from the current buffer
;; [+] Get all TODO's and
;; filter out those that
;; have a schedule whose
;; date is more than today
;;
;; [What you need to know]
;;
;;      * In order to read from
;;      the buffer, we are going
;;      to move around in this
;;      function. Because we
;;      want to come back to the
;;      same position after the
;;      function we wrap it in a
;;      "save-excursion". This
;;      function saves the
;;      current view and
;;      restores it after
;;      executing all it's
;;      parameters.
;;
;;      * A LISP list is
;;      constructed from nodes
;;      using the function
;;      `cons`. A list node has
;;      two slots - the first
;;      holds the element and
;;      the second holds a
;;      pointer to the next
;;      node. This is best
;;      visualized as follows:

;;  LISP-list-node.png

;;      Therefore we use the
;;      functions (car list) and
;;      (cdr list) to get the
;;      "contained element" and
;;      the "rest of the list"
;;      respectively.
;;
;;      * "Mapping" a list is
;;      the standard way of
;;      iterating over a list
;;      (sort of like a
;;      for-loop). The `mapcar`
;;      list takes a function to
;;      be executed and passes
;;      it the first (the `car`)
;;      element of each list node.

;;  mapcar.png

;;
;;      * "org-entry-properties"
;;      is a function written by
;;      the Org mode authors
;;      that we are simply
;;      reusing to find if an
;;      entry has been
;;      scheduled. Just how did
;;      we find this function?
;;      Well EMacs has an
;;      amazing ability to show
;;      us every function
;;      available! Anything that
;;      EMacs can do - you can
;;      do too!
;;      Explore this by finding
;;      what functions are bound
;;      to your keys:
;;          C-h C-k
;;      And then examining the
;;      function:
;;          C-h C-f
;;
;;      * A "lambda" is simply a
;;      way of naming an
;;      anonymous function. When
;;      you don't want to
;;      `defun` you `lambda` :-)
;;
;; Phew! Lots of weird names
;;   cons, car, cdr, mapcar, and lambda
;; but I hope you got them all.

;;      * As we discussed above,
;;      we can associate text
;;      displayed in an EMacs
;;      buffer with any
;;      properties we want.
;;      Some of these properties
;;      can be used to format
;;      the text but now we are
;;      using the properties to
;;      store the original
;;      location of the text so
;;      that we can return to it
;;      in our buffer when we
;;      hit 'ENTER' in the
;;      report.

;; And we're done! All we need
;; to do to get this report
;; working is to evaluate the
;; functions in this file and
;; press F5 in any org-mode TODO
;; list.

;; An easy way of evaluating all
;; the functions in a file while
;; you are coding is to call an
;; interactive function:
;; `eval-buffer` (M-x eval-buffer)

;; Once you're done, it is best
;; to put your file into your
;; [href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html](emacs configuration)
;; (~/.emacs) and load it using
;; the (load-file "do_today.el")
;; function.

;; Have fun playing with EMacs
;; and see you next time!
